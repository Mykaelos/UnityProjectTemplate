This Unity Project Template project is a project that ironically makes it faster to start new projects for me.

Unity Project Template setup steps:

1. Copy and paste everything in the CopyMyContents to your project.
2. Run gitinit-RUN-THEN-DELETE.bat
3. Delete gitinit-RUN-THEN-DELETE.bat
4. Create new repo at https://github.com/
5. Add remote URL via CMD 
	git remote add origin https://github.com/Mykaelos/<PROJECT_NAME>.git
	git push origin master
